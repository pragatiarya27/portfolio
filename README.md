Create a personal portfolio site.

I created a personal portfolio website using Flask in Python. It includes a homepage (`index.html`) with sections like About Me, Projects, and a Contact Form. The Flask app (`app.py`) serves this HTML and handles form submissions, showing a flash message when a user submits the contact form. Initially, I faced issues due to directly opening the HTML file instead of using Flask, and some Unicode errors, which were resolved by correcting special characters and viewing the site through `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
I have successfully built a personal portfolio website using Flask (a Python web framework). The project had three key parts:

1. **`app.py`** – the Python script that starts your Flask web server and handles page routing and form submissions.
2. **`templates/index.html`** – the HTML file that displays your portfolio content like name, projects, and a contact form.
3. **`static/style.css`** – the CSS file that styles your webpage.
